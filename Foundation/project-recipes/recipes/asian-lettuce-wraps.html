  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Delicious and bursting with flavor, Asian lettuce wraps are a great idea for entertaining or a family style meal. 
    Each person can build their own fresh, delicious wrap. Just be sure to have plates or napkins available since the 
    mixture can sometimes drip a little. To serve, allow each person to spoon a portion of the meat into a lettuce leaf. 
    Wrap the lettuce around the meat like a burrito and enjoy!</p>
